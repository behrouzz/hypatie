# hypatie
*A python package for astronomical calculations*


## Installation

Install the latest version of *hypatie* from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hypatie/):

    pip install hypatie

Requirements are *numpy*, *pandas* and *matplotlib*.


## Quick start

Let's get the positions of the sun between two times:

```python
import hypatie as hp

t1 = '2021-03-20 08:00:00'
t2 = '2021-03-20 10:00:00'
```

If you want the apparent RA and DEC of the Sun with respect to Earth's center (geocentric):

```python
obs = hp.Observer('sun', t1, t2, step=5)
```

Now you can access the time intervals with *.time* attribute:

```python
print(obs.time)

[datetime.datetime(2021, 3, 20, 8, 0)
 datetime.datetime(2021, 3, 20, 8, 24)
 datetime.datetime(2021, 3, 20, 8, 48)
 datetime.datetime(2021, 3, 20, 9, 12)
 datetime.datetime(2021, 3, 20, 9, 36)
 datetime.datetime(2021, 3, 20, 10, 0)]
```

To acces the position you can use *obs.pos*, *obs.ra*, or *obs.dec*:

```python
print(obs.pos)

[[ 3.59938235e+02 -2.66803120e-02]
 [ 3.59953431e+02 -2.00920520e-02]
 [ 3.59968627e+02 -1.35038600e-02]
 [ 3.59983823e+02 -6.91573600e-03]
 [ 3.59999018e+02 -3.27680000e-04]
 [ 1.42132560e-02  6.26030600e-03]]
```

The first column in the above array is RA and the second column is DEC.

It is possible to get the apparent RA & DEC of a targer with respect to a specified location on the surface of a body.
For example, if you want to get the apparent RA & DEC of the Sun for the Eiffel Tower :

```python
obs = hp.Observer('sun', t1, t2, step=5, center='2.2945,48.8584,300@399')
```

Note that 2.2945 is the longtitude, 48.8584 is the latitude and 300 (meters) is the elevation of the Eiffel Tower.
We have specified '@399' at the end which means that this coordinates is situated on the Earth (399 is the Earth's code).                                                                                           

You can request the cartesian positions (x,y,z) of a target with *Vector* class.

```python
vec = hp.Vector('sun', t1, t2, step=5)
```

As with the *Observer* class, there are two attributes *.time* and *.pos* for *Vector* class.
Note that when creating a Vector class, you have *.x*, *.y* and *.z* attributes instead of *.ra* and *.dec*.

For both *Vector* and *Observer* classes you can pass a single time to get position/state of a body at a single time:
```python
vec = hp.Vector('sun', t1)
```

Both *Vector* and *Observer* classes have *.plot()* method.
```python
# plot polar coordinates
obs.plot()
# plot cartesian coordinates
vec.plot()
```

## Example: animating James Webb Space Telescope

In addition to *.plot()* method of *Vector* and *Observer* classes, there's a *play()* function that you can pass it a list of Vector objects as well as some other lists as shown in the example below:

```python
import hypatie as hp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

t1 = '2018-10-01 14:18:00'
t2 = '2024-12-31 12:18:00'

# get positions with respect to the barycenter of earth-moon
earth = hp.Vector('399', t1, t2, center='500@3', step=1000)
moon = hp.Vector('301', t1, t2, center='500@3', step=1000)
jwst = hp.Vector('-170', t1, t2, center='500@3', step=1000)

bodies = [earth, moon, jwst]
names = ['Earth', 'Moon', 'James Webb']
colors = ['b','g','r']
sizes = [20, 8, 3]

# play the animation
anim = hp.play(bodies, names, colors, sizes)
plt.show()
```

## Deep sky

You can download data from astronomical catalogues:
```python
cat = Catalogue('gaia2')
data, meta = cat.download()
```

or, plot the star chart for your location:
```python
ax = hp.star_chart(lon=2.2945, lat=48.8584)
plt.show()
```
